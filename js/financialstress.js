  Another factor that can weigh heavily on a student's mind is financial stress.
  Being a student often means living on a tight budget, which can significantly impact mental well-being. A majority of students report that financial concerns are a constant source of stress - especially in a country like India, where education comes at a cost. The pressure of managing expenses while trying to focus on studies can take a serious toll on mental health.

  It may not come as a surprise that financial stress and depression can influence suicidal thoughts among students. However, when comparing levels of financial stress and depression with the prevalence of suicidal ideation, the connection becomes even more evident. This highlights just how crucial it is to ensure students have the financial support they need in order to maintain both their academic focus and mental well-being.
