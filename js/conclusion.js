  ## Conclusion 

  In the begining of this project I set out to find out more about *"The balance of being a Student"*, which we have explored with the support of the SQLite dataset with answers from over 25 000 Indian students. I aimed to understand how different aspects of student life - such as study satisfaction, financial stress, diet, and sleep - interact with academic performance and mental well-being.

  ### Invetigated hypotheses
  * Students with low Study Satisfaction are more likely to be depressed. 
  * Students with Financial Stress are more likely to be depressed, and more likely to have Sucidial Thoughts.
  * Students with good Dietary Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.
  * Students with good Sleeping Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.

  **Students with low Study Satisfaction are more likely to be depressed.** <br>
  Regarding the first hypothesis, we can unfortunately observe that a general sense of depression exists among students. However, the data indicates a clear trend: higher levels of study satisfaction are associated with lower levels of depression. In fact, students who report being dissatisfied with their studies tend to experience significantly more depressive symptoms compared to those who are more content.

  **Students with Financial Stress are more likely to be depressed, and more likely to have Sucidial Thoughts.** <br>
  As for the second hypothesis, the findings also support its validity. It becomes evident - though both surprising and understandable - just how profoundly financial dependence impacts students. The data underscores that financial stress is not a minor concern, but rather a major factor affecting students' overall mental health and academic well-being.

  **Students with good Dietary Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.** <br>
  From the data that we've taken a look at we can conclude that this hypothesis is not true, most students reported having a unhelathy diet, no matter the grade. The data shows that students' dietary habits don’t strongly correlate with academic performance. Most students, including high achievers, report unhealthy eating - suggesting that poor diet doesn't necessarily lower grades. Interestingly, students with average grades show the highest rates of unhealthy eating, while those with lower grades often report a little bit more healthier diets, possibly reflecting a focus on long-term well-being over academic pressure.

  **Students with good Sleeping Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.** <br>
  Surprisingly, the hypothesis that better sleep leads to better academic performance does not align with the data. In fact, students with the highest CGPA scores often report sleeping fewer hours than those with lower grades. This suggests that many high-achieving students may be sacrificing sleep - and even diet - for the sake of academic success. Across the board, we see a recurring theme: health and well-being are often deprioritized in student life. While performance is important, these results highlight the need for better balance between academic goals and personal health.

  ## What is the Balance of Being a Student?

  The data suggests that for many students, balance is hard to achieve. Academic pressure often outweighs personal health, with students sacrificing sleep, diet, and mental well-being in pursuit of success. While some level of dedication is necessary, these findings point to a need for more support systems that help students maintain both performance and personal wellness. A healthier balance is not just ideal - it’s essential for sustainable success and well-being.

  ### Final Thoughts 
  - I realized that the *sleep_duration* column lacked an important option: students who sleep between 6 and 7 hours. The dataset only allowed responses for less than 6 hours or more than 7, leaving out a significant group. This forced students to choose the closest option, which may have led to misleading or less accurate data.
  - Another aspect I could have explored is whether the type of degree program had any influence on student well-being. Different academic tracks may come with varying levels of pressure, satisfaction, or time demands.
  - It would also have been valuable to know which university or college the students attended. This could help reveal whether factors like public vs. private institutions influence levels of study satisfaction or financial stress.

  ### Shapiro-Wilk

  Unfortunately I was not able to do a normal distribution/Shapiro Wilk-test, that was working that is. The one I tried to do was not being cooperative and therefore not shown in this project. 

  If you are my teacher reading this, and this content is important for my grade, please don't hesitate to reach out - I will make the necessary additions as soon as possible.
