  ### About the data
  Welcome reader, this is a school project where I use SQLite and JavaScript to show the results of a dataset regarding students in India and depression. 

  The orginal data has been cleaned due to some answers being not relevant, such as profession being anything else than *Student*. The data is from a survey where students answered questions about their mental health and other factors.

  Other than that I have changed answers in some coloumns, such as Suidical Thoughts, to be 0 or 1, instead of Yes and No. The same change has been made to the coloumn that regards Family History of Mental Illness.
