  ## Conclusion 

  In the begining of this project I set out to find out more about *"The balance of being a Student"*, which we have explored with the support of the SQLite dataset with answers from over 25 000 Indian students. 

  ### Invetigated hypotheses
  * Students with low Study Satisfaction are more likely to be depressed. 
  * Students with Financial Stress are more likely to be depressed, and more likely to have Sucidial Thoughts.
  * Students with good Dietary Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.
  * Students with good Sleeping Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.

  **Students with low Study Satisfaction are more likely to be depressed.** <br>
  Regarding the first hypothesis, we can unfortunately observe that a general sense of depression exists among students. However, the data indicates a clear trend: higher levels of study satisfaction are associated with lower levels of depression. In fact, students who report being dissatisfied with their studies tend to experience significantly more depressive symptoms compared to those who are more content.

  **Students with Financial Stress are more likely to be depressed, and more likely to have Sucidial Thoughts.** <br>
  As for the second hypothesis, the findings also support its validity. It becomes evident - though both surprising and understandable - just how profoundly financial dependence impacts students. The data underscores that financial stress is not a minor concern, but rather a major factor affecting students' overall mental health and academic well-being.

  **Students with good Dietary Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.** <br>
  From the data that we've taken a look at we can conclude that this hypothesis is not true, quite the oppisite, which is suprising for me. But also makes sense as perhaps a lot of students that wants to keep a above average grade decided to spend less time on making sure they eat healthy and propably more time on their studies. 

  **Students with good Sleeping Habits are less likely to have a low CGPA.** <br>
  Surprisingly, the hypothesis that better sleep leads to better academic performance does not align with the data. In fact, students with the highest CGPA scores often report sleeping fewer hours than those with lower grades. This suggests that many high-achieving students may be sacrificing sleep - and even diet - for the sake of academic success. Across the board, we see a recurring theme: health and well-being are often deprioritized in student life. While performance is important, these results highlight the need for better balance between academic goals and personal health.

  ### Shapiro-Wilk

  Unfortunately I was not able to do a normal distribution/Shapiro Wilk-test, that was working that is. The one I tried to do was not being cooperative and therefore not shown in this project. 

  If you are my teacher reading this, and this content is important for my grade, please don't hesitate to reach out - I will make the necessary additions as soon as possible.
